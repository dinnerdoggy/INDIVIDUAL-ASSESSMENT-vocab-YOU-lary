Here I am putting an overview of what my project is about. It comes below the name of my project so that others can read what it is about and get more details.

[View App](#https://caseystechvocab.netlify.app/)

## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a coding student
- They are new to coding and need to reference definitions often
- The problem this app solves for them is that it gives them a quick reference to some concept definitions, and gives them the ability to add their own so that they can build a library of quick reference cards suited to their own progress.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- When a new definition is added, the data is pushed to a firebase database, and then rendered onto the dom in a card
- The user can edit existing cards
- The user can delete cards
- The user can add their own cards.
- The user can only see the cards that have been created on their sign in account
